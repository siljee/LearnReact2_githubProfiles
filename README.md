# Class vs functions

Recommended to use functions and much easier (more readable, less code). 
But classes can be more flexible. And used in old apps before React Hooks (functions did not have state.)
Thus, this app is created with Classes. 

## Class

**Render-function**

A React Class-component must have a render function. 
It returnes the viritual DOM description of your component. 

**This**

Props is accessed from `this`: 
```js
{this.props.title}
```

**Constructor**
